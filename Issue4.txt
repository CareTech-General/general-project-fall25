There are significantly more images in the "Pneumonia" class 
than in the "Normal" class (3875 in Pneumonia, 1341 in Normal)

Pneumonia images show the lungs as more opaque and white in certain parts (indicating fluid)
while the normal images have clear lungs. Normal pictures show the black background in higher 
contrast with the bones than in the pneumonia images.

There are a lot of different image resolutions which means they have to be resized to
uniform dimensions during preproccessing.
